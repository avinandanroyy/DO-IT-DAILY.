# Do-It-Daily

This is the landing page for the Do-It-Daily community. I built it to be minimal, sharp, and fast.

## How to run it

1.  Make sure you have **Node.js** installed.
2.  Open this folder in your terminal (or VS Code).
3.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the local server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
5.  Click the link that pops up (usually `http://localhost:5173`) to see the site.

## Tech Stack

Here is what I used to build this:

*   **React + TypeScript** (using Vite for the build tool)
*   **Tailwind CSS** for all the styling
*   **Three.js** (@react-three/fiber) for the particle wave background
*   **Framer Motion** for the text reveals
*   **Lucide React** for the icons
